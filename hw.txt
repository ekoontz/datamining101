Homework 1 to Machine Learning 101 : Answers by Eugene Koontz (ekoontz@hiro-tan.org)

1

a) "Determine whether each of the two attributes (columns) is treated
as qualitative (categorical) or quantitative (numeric) using
R. Explain how you can tell using R."

First column is quantitative; the second is qualitative:

I can tell the first column is quantitative because sum() works:

> sum(data[1])
[1] 3186

I can tell the second column is qualitative because sum() doesn't work:

> sum(data[2])
Error in FUN(X[[1L]], ...) : 
    only defined on a data frame with all numeric variables

and thus not all values are numeric.

b) "What is the specific problem that causes one of these two
attributes to be read in as qualitative (categorical) when it seems it
should be quantitative (numeric)?"

There's a "two" in the second column.

c) "Use the command plot() in R to make a plot for each column by
entering plot(data[,1]) and plot(data[,2]). Because one variable is
read in as quantitative (numeric) and the other as qualitative
(categorical) these two plots are showing completely different things
by default. Explain exactly what is being plotted in each of the two
cases. Include these two plots in your homework."

In plot(data[,1]), the first column's values are being displayed as
the range, with the row index as the domain. 
In plot(data[,2]), a histogram is being generated for all the possible
values in the second column.


d) "Read the data into Excel. Excel should have no problem opening the
file directly since it is .csv. Create a new column that is equal to
the second column plus 10. What is the result for the problem
observations (rows) you identified in part b? What specific outcome
does Excel display?"

Outlook displays: "#VALUE!".

2) 

a) "Read the data into R using data<-
read.csv("twomillion.csv",header=FALSE)...Extract a
simple random sample with replacement of 10,000 observations
(rows). Show your R commands for doing this."

> samp <- sample(data[,1],10000,TRUE)

b) "For your sample, use the functions mean(), max(), var() and
quantile(,.25) to compute the mean, maximum, variance and 1st quartile
respectively. Show your R code and the resulting values."

> mean(samp)
[1] 9.470383
> max(samp)
[1] 16.3303
> var(samp)
[1] 4.004343
> quantile(samp,.25)
     25% 
8.128114 


c)"Compute the same quantities in part b on the entire data set and show
your answers. How much do they differ from your answers in part b?"

> mean(data[,1])
[1] 9.451468
> max(data[,1])
[1] 18.96657
> var(data[,1])
[1] 4.001822
> quantile(data[,1],.25)
    25% 
8.10388 
> 

The max differs by a lot; the others, not so much difference.

d) Excel question..

e) Assuming Excel fails somehow.

3. "This question uses a sample of 1500 California house prices.."

a) "Use R to produce a single graph displaying a boxplot for each set" 

> oh_prices<- read.csv("OH_house_prices.csv",header=FALSE)
> ca_prices<- read.csv("CA_house_prices.csv",header=FALSE)
> boxplot(ca_prices[,1],oh_prices[,1],col="blue", 
           main=" House Boxplot ", names=c("CA houses","Ohio houses"),ylab="Prices")

b) "Use R to produce a frequency histogram for only the California
house prices. Use intervals of width $500,000 beginning at 0 and
ending at $3.5 million. Include the R commands and the plot. Put your
name in the title of the plot."

> hist(ca_prices[,1],c(500*0:7),main = "House prices in California by Group J")

c) Use R to plot the ECDF of the California houses and Ohio houses on
the same graph (see example2.r). Include a legend. Include the R
commands and the plot. Put your name in the title of the plot."

> plot(ecdf(ca_prices[,1]),col="black",main="ECDF of CA and OH House Prices by Group J")
> par(new=TRUE)
> plot(ecdf(oh_prices[,1]),col="red",main="")

4.  

a) "Use plot() in R to make a scatter plot for this data with 2003
wins on the x- axis and 2004 wins on the y-axis. Use the range 0 to 12
for both the x-axis and y-axis. Include the R commands and the
plot. Put your name in the title of the plot."

> wins <- read.csv('football.csv') 
> plot(wins[,2],wins[,3],xlab="2003 wins",ylab="2004 wins",main="Group J")

b) "Why are there fewer than 117 points visible on your graph in part
a? Describe the solution we discussed in class to deal with this
problem (but don't actually do it)."

Don't remember the solution discussed in class; maybe use a third dimension or coloring
to show counts for same (2003 wins,2004 wins) value?

c) "Compute the correlation in R using the function cor()."

> cor(wins[,2],wins[,3])
[1] 0.6537691

d) "How does the value in part c change if you add 10 to all the values for 2004?"

> cor(wins[,2],wins[,3] + 10)
[1] 0.6537691

Not at all.

e) "How does the value in part c change if you multiply all the 2004 values by 2?"

> cor(wins[,2],wins[,3] * 2)
[1] 0.6537691

Not at all.

f) "How does the value in part c change if you multiply all the 2004 values by -2?"

> cor(wins[,2],wins[,3] * -2)
[1] -0.6537691
> 

Same magnitude but negative.

5. "This question uses the sample of 10,000 Ohio house prices"

a) "What is the median value? Is it larger or smaller than the mean?"

> oh_house_prices <- read.csv('OH_house_prices.csv')
> median(oh_house_prices[,1])
[1] 118
> mean(oh_house_prices[,1])
[1] 190.3132

The mean is larger.

b) "What does your answer to part a suggest about the shape of the
distribution (right-skewed or left-skewed)?"

It is left-skewed : more houses are less than the mean than are above it.

c) "How does the median change if you add 10 (thousand dollars) to all the values?"

> median(oh_house_prices[,1]+10)
[1] 128

It increases by exactly 10 dollars.

d) "How does the median change if you multiply all the values by 2?"

> median(oh_house_prices[,1]*2)
[1] 236

It increases by a bit less than twice.

5. " This question uses the following people's ages: 19,23,30,30,45,25,24,20."
a) "Compute the standard deviation in R using the sd() function."

> sd(ages)
[1] 8.315218

b) "Compute the same value by hand and show all the steps."

> mean(ages)
[1] 27
> ages - mean(ages)
[1] -8 -4  3  3 18 -2 -3 -7
> (ages - mean(ages))^2
[1]  64  16   9   9 324   4   9  49
> sum((ages - mean(ages))^2)
[1] 484
> sum((ages - mean(ages))^2)/length(ages)
[1] 60.5
> sqrt(sum((ages - mean(ages))^2)/length(ages))
[1] 7.778175

c) "Using R, how does the value in part a change if you add 10 to all the values?"

> sd(ages+10)
[1] 8.315218

No change.

d) "Using R, how does the value in part a change if you multiply all the values by 100?"

> sd(ages * 100)
[1] 831.5218

Increases by 100.
